Why there's two version?
- Because after having rearranged 3 tabs, I've got more experience to work with guitar pro, and increased my ability to listen what note and skill exactly. So, I decide to make a V2.
----------------------------------------------------------
Changes between V1 and V2 version:
- Change tuning to Half Step Down (Baritone is still fine) 
- Change names of Sections
- Repeat symbol at Intro, Chorus - Extended
- Remove arrow symbol (that's too hard to see), replace with Pickstroke Up / Down
- Change 'Palm' to 'P', Slap symbol to 'S', 'Strongly Pluck' to 'Bass Slap'
- Mostly changes in 'Slapping Harmonic' Section (change for best symbol)
- Fix some notes, length of notes (or duration of notes idk how to call it) in Intro, Midtro, Chorus and Verse
- Change Accented Notes, Heavily Accented Notes
- Add Finger symbol in some places
- Resize the Bars
